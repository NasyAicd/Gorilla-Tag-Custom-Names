## Custom names:
1) Staying in the directory you just used to install it there should now be a file called "!name_config.txt"
2) Open this document by double-clicking
3) The first line is the frame step between names, basically how many frames to wait before changing your name I'd recommend 60-120 but it will depend on your computer and may need some tinkering
4) The rest of the lines are the names to scroll through, you may have as many as you want!
5) Launch the game and enjoy!
