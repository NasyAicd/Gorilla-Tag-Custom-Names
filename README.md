# Gorilla Tag Custom Names
A non-intrusive name mod for the amazing game Gorilla Tag
### Please note: this mod WILL work on public servers, however you are wholly responsible for any reports and/or bans you may receive

## To install:
### Using BepInEx
Simply download the plugin folder (dll + text config) [Click here to download](https://github.com/jeydevv/Gorilla-Tag-Custom-Names/releases/download/1.1.0/CustomNames.zip), extract the folder then move it into your BepInEx/plugins folder in your game directory

## Custom names:
Go to BepInEx/plugins/CustomNames and open the text file (name_config.txt)
1) In this file the first number (by default 30) is the frame delay, this cannot go below 20 to prevent lag, 30 will be around 1/2 a second to 1/4 of a second
3) The rest of the lines are the names that will be cycled through top-down, by default this spells out "I want to be" then "monke" (with alternating capitalization) - IGNORE THE -999
